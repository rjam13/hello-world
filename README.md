Introduction to GitHub

Hi, my name is Rey Jairus Marasigan

This is my first time using GitHub and marks the beginning of my Computer Science career. 

If you are reading this from the future, I hope that I have accomplished many things such as, but not limited to:
Graduating with a CS degree
learning different languages 
being able to create an app from nothing
being able to create a website from nothing
At least have some knowledge of creating machine learning projects

At the time of writing this, I hope that I will achieve that things listed above while staying with the same mindset of dedication and motivation that I have right now. Stay hungry, Stay foolish.
